Long train journey&#8217;s are usually boring unless you get someone to chat for long duration. Firstly to my surprise I got a train ticket just 1 day in advance. I was just elated by the fact that I got a ticket to travel home. As usual if you are traveling from Bangalore to any place you will always get to meet Software professionals in the train. Most of them usually have earphones on or a book in their hand. If the Indian trains are provided with wifi everyone will just ignore the person next to him/her. 

I try to strike up a conversation with a stranger but I am usually not the first one to start. Probably everyone in here was just waiting for someone to start a conversation. Then comes the most enthusiastic person of the lot, Jayanth (Jai) a 4 year old kid. I instantly liked this kid. He was not like other kids cribbing or irritating people. He had that lovely innocent smile when he was shy. In fact everyone around was just observing this cute kid. 

The first thing one would observe is the respect he used in his language. It is difficult to define respect in English as there are no extra respectful terms. Let me explain &#8220;You&#8221; in Indian languages has two versions (Telugu) &#8220;nuvvu&#8221;, &#8220;meeru&#8221; (respectful you). So for every word there would be a respectable version especially used for elders. This was the first time I had seen a 4 year old kid use such a respect when addressing people. Normally all kids address their dads in Telugu &#8220;Nanna&#8221;, but Jai used to call &#8220;Nanngaru&#8221; (even I don&#8217;t use that). Of course if I start calling my Dad that he would definitely get a shock.

Every kid is curious at that age. Jai was constantly asking questions however silly they were. His father was patiently answering his queries. After every answer he listened he bombarded another question. For some even I did not have answers. For example why are there rocks between the railway track? I observed it earlier but never thought to question that. Kids are always inspiring with respect to their inquisitive thoughts. I was quite curious to know how his father answered them. Sometimes his father dogged the questions by agreeing that he did not know. I think it is okay to say &#8220;I do not know&#8221; rather than making up any random shit. Especially to kids since their minds are like a blank slate and it just imprints in their mind. I had a chat with his Dad and realized sometimes how he is stuck with the dilemma of what is good or bad with respect parenting. This is a quite an interesting debate but it is always good to know the two sides.

Lets take an example:  
How much exposure should one give a kid to the cartoon channels?  
If you stop them from watching cartoon channels they would feel lost when others kids are talking about it. If you allow them to watch there is always a possibility to overdo it. Probably things in vigilance would be the only way out.

I think it would not be right to alinate them 

I will definitely remember them as one of the respectable father son combo and of course as my loved brother. I forgot to take their address but I would be glad if we met accidentally.
