&#8220;I believe I can fly&#8221; this is how it feels when you are literally high. For adventure freaks paragliding is yet another fascinating sport. Flying is thrilling, it feels as if we have wings like a bird and are soaring in the sky. Its a fairly safe sport with some risk definitely involved, but with proper guidance its 99% safe.

The most important thing required for personal safety is the right attitude.  
I graduated in the P1 Beginners course from <a href="http://templepilots.com/" title="Templepilots" target="_blank">Templepilots</a> near Talegown, Pune. 

After the end of the course I am definitely **Paraddicted**. My next target will be to get my flying certification so that I have a license to fly.
