&#8220;I believe I can fly&#8221; this is how it feels when you are literally high. For adventure freaks this is yet another fascinating sport. I recently graduated in the P1 Beginners course from <a href="http://templepilots.com/" title="Templepilots" target="_blank">Templepilots</a> near Talegown, Pune.

Flying is so thrilling, it just feels as if we have wings like a bird and we are cruising down to the ground. Its fairly safe sport with some risk definitely involved, but with proper guidance its 100% safe. The most important thing required for personal safety is the right attitude.

After the end of the course I am definitely &#8220;Paraddicted&#8221;. My next target will be to get my flying certification so that I have a license to fly.
