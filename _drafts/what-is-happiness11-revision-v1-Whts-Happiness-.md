This is one of my greatest discussions ever (6 hour long &#8211; 00:00 hrs to 6:00 am)&#8230; Before starting off with the theme i should introduce you to 4 people among whom this discussion took place.

 **Rahul** : (a.k.a Saladi,ITEM) my langoti yar (family friend and 1st &#8211; 4th classmate ). It is difficult to describe him in few sentences, he deserves a blog to be written on his name :P..Well in few words he is a sheer genius,an allrounder, and a famous ITEM one had ever seen (he surely agrees to this) :D&#8230;(Most our thoughts match)

**Ravi Kiran V**: (a.k.a Pilla) Got close to this guy in second year. One thing you will first observe is his height. Anyways this guy is a good dancer(my guru),guitarist,player and an alltime flirt :d. If you are close to this guy he will do anything for you..(Doesn&#8217;t really agree to you quickly)

**Srivatsava Daruru**: (a.k.a Daruru,Dadda) This guy is highly talented.. Topper of our batch&#8230; Great philosopher and a poet..Plans to do lots of things but doesn&#8217;t really come into limelight&#8230; Right now in Texas Austin doing his MS.. (Well this guy actually thinks twice before doing anything..)

**Avinesh PVS**: (a.k.a Avi,Avigates) Well nothing much about this guy. He has lots of plans to do. Gets inspired quickly from anything. Tries to all things least bothers whether he can do or not.. This guys mind is very fickle. Only thing is that he has lots of thoughts in mind and end up implementing few things (good thing is that atleast few things are done :D)..About his aspirations and dreams i will need another post.Anyways Continuing with my post.

Ok the story goes on like this..

It was the day Daruru got his bike. Rest of us thought we have to get a treat from him and we all went for dinner @ Olive gardens. We came back to college @ around 00:00 hrs. I was the initiator of this discussion. I asked **&#8220;Whts Happiness to You???&#8221; Is it money,fame,power or anything else??** (theme derived from a Hindi Movie)..**Ravi** said **&#8220;Happiness to me is money&#8230;I want money so that i can buy gifts for others&#8221;** :O (he is a gift freak.. likes to give gifts to people close to him).. **Daruru** said **&#8220;Well for me money is very important&#8221;**.. **Rahul and I** were like **whts the point in having money,stress and not having mental peace**..Then I said **_&#8220;Consider that you have an option of choosing between a 20 lac job (which sucks big time) and a 12 lac (which you really like) which one will you take up?? &#8220;_**.. **Ravi** immediately said **&#8220;20 lac job&#8230;&#8221;**..**I** was like &#8220;**You are not atall happy in the process of earning money still you wanna take up the job????**&#8220;.. He was still adamant of taking that job&#8230;Rahul and I were the one&#8217;s supporting happiness is in doing the process not in result..i.e. If it is true that one is no atall happy doing the work then how can he/she be happy???.. But Ravi and Daruru also had their point that they are more happy from the result&#8230; i.e. what ever happens to them they don&#8217;t care, but they see happiness in the happiness of others&#8230; Well considering the fact that we fought for around 6 hours on the same issue, finally we came to a decision that both process and result are equally important for happiness. It is how one balances them.. This was pretty old discussion so couldn&#8217;t actually remember how this discussion took place for 6 hours.. (Argument between two opposite thoughts can take any no. of hours).. Ultimately people agreed to each others thoughts and respected them :D&#8230;

After this i came to know everyone has their own point of view of happiness. But yeah one thing is for sure is that Happiness is what you really feel from inside, if you try to fake it from outside there is no point.. You can fake it on your friends but you cannot fake yourself. If one cannot achieve after lots of hardwork one should be happy that he/she atleast tried hard, but they are destined for that. Happiness is what one considers in every possible thing. For example: If there is breakup of a couple (bf and gf) .. There is no point in being unhappy.. Rather one can think what has happened has happened for good (their ideas are not matching and probably they cannot get along) and live their lives happily..So life is really short, live happily forever..

Well lam a kindof person who can be happy from what I have and what I achieve. What kindof person are you???
