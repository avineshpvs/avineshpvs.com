I am a Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Data Mining programmer. Language and the patterns associated with it have always intrigued me. 

**Some facts about me:** I am a graduate in Computer Science with specialisation in NLP from [Language Technologies Research Centre](http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in "Language Technologies Research Centre") [IIIT-Hyderabad](http://iiit.ac.in/ "IIIT Hyderabad"). My Master&#8217;s thesis was on  [&#8220;Transfer Grammar Engine and Automatic Learning of Reorder Rules in Machine Translation&#8221;](http://tinyurl.com/qzjkf9l) tried and tested on English-Hindi Machine Translation system. During my Research Assistantship at IIIT-Hyderabad, I played a pivotal role in building an Indian Language Machine Translation (MT) System, named SAMPARK, funded by Department of IT, Govt. of India. 

After graduation I worked with  [Lexical Computing Ltd.](http://www.sketchengine.co.uk/?page=Website/Company "Lexical Computing Limited") for 3 years. My knowledge in MT gave me an opportunity to work on an interesting EU research project namely PRESEMT. At LCL, I collaborated with several well-known NLP researchers such as Dr Adam Kilgarriff, Dr Diana McCarthy, Dr Simon Smith.

After working as a freelancer for LCL, I went to taste the real corporate job at IBM Watson group. I worked on concept mining from clinical records at IBM Watson in collaboration with IBM Research and MD Anderson Cancer Research Centre. 

Right now I am on a break and travelling India on my Bike. On my way, I am also freelancing mainly in Python, NLP, Data Mining and Machine Learning.

This website will mainly consist of my writings about latest projects, [NLP & Data mining tools](http://www.avineshpvs.com/nlpgadgets "Natural Language Processing blog"), [Travel logs, Adventure](http://www.avineshpvs.com/travel "Travel And Adventures") & [my experiences](http://avineshpvs.com/blog "Blog"). 

**Interests:** NLP, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Corpus Linguistics, Information Extraction & Information Retrieval.

Before college, I was just another student from India having dreamt of IIT&#8217;s. Not bad but I landed at IIIT-Hyderabad which has an extra &#8216;I&#8217;. I was just part of the race for a long time, but since a couple of years, I have done what I really love. Now I am quite obsessed with living my life to the fullest and on the way striking off items from [my bucketlist](http://www.avineshpvs.com/101-bucket-list "Bucketlist!!"). 

**Hobbies:** Fitness, Adventure Sports (Skiing, Surfing, Paragliding, Hiking) and Travelling

Apart from work, I am a fitness freak and adventure junkie. I love to travel and meet different people. It&#8217;s both fun to be with people and the mountains. I am a P1 certificate paragliders, Intermediate Skier, Advanced Open Water certified Scuba diver and hiker. Hope to tick off more adventures in future.
