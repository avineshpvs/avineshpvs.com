This page is about my journey across India meeting new people and understanding different cultures. This idea sparked in me when I was backpacking across Europe. I met couple of Europeans who had more knowledge about India compared to that of me. I felt bad that being an Indian I didn‚Äôt see as much as them. That is when I decided to ride across India. 

This idea to travel sprouted when I didn‚Äôt even have a motor bike. To embark on this adventure I needed two things 1. Cash in the account 2. A cruise bike. For the first one I took up a 9-5 job corporate job and saved sufficient amount of money. For the later one I decided to take either a Royal Enfield or Bajaj Avenger. After a lot of analysis, I decided to take Bajaj Avenger 220cc.

I had to decide the right time to quit my job. The thought process was mainly about the next things in life. I had a great time at IBM Watson working on state of art technologies. But I had to decide what next in terms of personal as well as professional growth. So I applied for PhD and meanwhile take a break before committing myself for 3-4 years. So here starts the journey of the LoneRider.

So what is this whole trip about?  
Well this trip is a completely unplanned trip. I wanted to taste different cultures and meet as many people as possible from different aspects of life.

**Why ride alone?**  
Lot of people asked me why I am travelling alone and suggest me to take someone along the way. I don‚Äôt mind riding along with like minded people, but who has free time like me. This trip is completely unplanned. I travel as per my mood and interest. If I like the place I don‚Äôt mind staying an extra day otherwise I would just shorten my stay. So it is better to ride alone right? üòÄ

**So how are you planning this trip?**  
In few words I have a rough plan in mind but it will be enhanced on the go. For example: I initially planned to ride south from Jaisalmer. But I met a lovely Punjabi family there and I have decided to ride north. Since I decided that I would not ride more than 300km a day. I decide to stay in a village/city/town in 300km radius from my current destination. I prefer to stay in 

What about accommodation?

  * **Couch Surfing:** An interesting concept of staying with local.This gives me the opportunity to know their culture as well as share interesting stories.
  * **Youth Hostel India:** I am a lifetime member of Youth Hostel India. There are roughly around 700 hostels across India. These are quite cheap and reduces my cost of travelling.  
    Hotels and Hostels: The last and final option I usually take is staying in a hotel or hostel. There is an interesting app called ‚Äú[Ixigo Road trip](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ixigo.ontheway&hl=en "Ixigo Road trip App")‚Äù, which recommends places nearby to stay.</p> 
    Stay tuned to know more about what all things I am carrying and numerous travel stories.
