    A child is always a child for their parents, however old they grow..

The most common question that youngsters ask themselves **&#8220;Am I a CHILD or an ADULT??&#8221;**. Have I grown up?? Am I mature enough to take my own decisions??

Well everyone wants to grow up early and get the tag of an adult. There is a lot to the word ADULT.  
<!--more-->

In college I am the boss of myself.. I take my own decisions. I feel myself to be an ADULT..

But @ Home &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; **Still a CHILD**&#8230;

There are 3 characters in the story.. **Granny**, **Mother** and a **Son**.

The day when Son was going by a train to his college. Mother started delivering the usual dialogs.

Son take care of yourself. Have you packed all things (10 times). Have you kept Vibhudi on your forehead (Saibaba tilak) ?? (if it is already put by her, she will put it again). Mind you Son is not traveling for the first time, he traveled umpteen several times to many places alone. Still Mom is scared and makes sure everything is alright at every stage of the journey. Son receives calls after every hour asking about where and how is he now. This is what is called &#8220;Mother&#8217;s love and affection&#8221;. Sometimes I feel why does she treat me like this. Haven&#8217;t I grown up?? Can&#8217;t I take care of myself ?? Sometimes I even get annoyed and I get into an argument with my Mom.

**So the question now is till when are we treated like this?**

The Answer is **ALL THE TIME**&#8230; (Even if you have Kids :D)

I experienced this when my Granny was treating my MOM the same way. (I was enjoying the moment).

My Mom was not feeling well. She fell down and injured her finger (minor injury). The time my Granny heard the news she panicked in worry. She started treating her like a small kid who injured herself while playing in the school. There were other instances when my Mom was traveling alone and the story repeated.

This shows how Moms are always Moms. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you are 16 or 60.

But the truth is I like it and I am sure many like it too. It shows someone really cares for you. If I have to be a child for this, then it is worth it. So do you like being treated as  **a Child or an Adult** ??
