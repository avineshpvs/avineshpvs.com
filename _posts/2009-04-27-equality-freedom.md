It&#8217;s about 3 friends discussing about their future, freedom & enjoyment in life. At 23 Its a usual scenario that when young minds meet these are the topics that come to their minds.

What is our next plan? Are we enjoying our life? Will we be doing what we have planned for? 

<!--more-->

F1: Female â™€ working M1: Male â™‚ working M2: Male â™‚ studying

The conversation goes on like this:

F1: So what do you wanna do in the future guys??

M2: Go to Europe for further studies & enjoy life.

M1: Be in a job and go for trips with my team and with friends.

M1&M2: What about you?

F1: Get married. I am really bored in life ðŸ™‚

M1&M2: :O.. What ??? You wanna get married because you are bored of life and work?

F1: At least I will have someone on weekends to go out with.

M2: Arey Dumbo at least u have friends to go out with now. Once you are married, you will have only one person to go out with. Also dude what about the freedom?? You will not have it anymore.

F1: That is what is the problem. I have no freedom like you guys. To go out I have to take permission from my parents. To go to a party.. **parents permission**. To go for a trip.. **parents permission**. And obviously it is not always YES :(. My life is really boring. I wanna enjoy my life.

Now we understood she also had a point. If a guy wants to do something he usually gets affirmative replies from his parents, but a gal generally needs to plead, promise and what not to convince their parents. Even then they don&#8217;t get the green signal. I heard from lot of my friends _**I wish I was a guy**_, I wanna enjoy like you guys.

So you might ask _**why is that parents are too caring about their daughters and curb their freedom?**_ Is it that this is a male dominating society and a boy can live in any situation and a gal cannot? What might be the reason?

One cannot blame parents for this. They are being over protective only because they see examples from the society and make up their mind. So when does a gal really get freedom? When is she going to do something by on her own and enjoy life? I remember a line from one of my grandma&#8217;s friend (she is 60 now) **&#8220;_During my teens my parents controlled me. When I was 20-30, I had to live for my husband. When I was 30-60, I had to live for my children (without embarrassing them). Now (at 60), I have time for myself and I am going for a world tour&#8221;_**.

So gals just checkout when you really have time for yourself.
