30 before 30 as the name suggests it is a list to be accomplished before I am 30.

Some of you might have read my <a href="http://www.avineshpvs.com/101-bucket-list" target="_blank">101 bucket list</a> from the earlier posts. Past couple of years have been quite productive in achieving some of them, but the pace has been quite slow. So to speed up and make it interesting I have made this new short term plan in view of the bigger bucket list. The idea here is tick of as many things as possible from this list before my 30th birthday. I have recently celebrated by 28th birthday, so roughly I have 2 years to strike of the list.

So how many do you think that I will be able to accomplish? Do you have a similar list? Incase you have interesting suggestions please do so in the comments section below.
